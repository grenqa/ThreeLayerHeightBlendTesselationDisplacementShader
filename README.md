# ThreeLayerHeightBlendTesselationDisplacementShader
1. 3 layers of materials height blended together using splat map.  
2. Distance based tesselation and displacement  
3. Detailed control

If you want to have shadows on tesselated geometry, add "addshadow" to the end of the line 57.

Maybe this is not the best example, but I did not have more suitable textures.
